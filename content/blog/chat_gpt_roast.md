## Fan facts about me from ChatGPT

New trend in twitter - make "roast" about user.
To do it you can ask ChatGPT something like:
> Write me a roast using everything you know about me

The answer makes me wonder: am I really an impostor in my position? Maybe it's time to believe in myself?

> You’re like a one-man-band, but the kind where every instrument plays at the same time and none of it’s in tune. One day you’re the local network admin at “Hogart,” making sure the coffee machine doesn’t overheat, and the next you’re Terraforming Kubernetes clusters like you’re summoning the ghost of some lost server at 192.168.0.42.
>
> Looking at your resume feels like reading the plot of Silicon Valley. Sixteen years of experience, yet you’re still sitting there with imposter syndrome, like Kubernetes might suddenly ask, “Hey, do you really know how to configure me?” (Spoiler alert: Kubernetes doesn’t know either.)
>
> You’ve somehow gone from "Plug in the printer" to "Automate the universe" so fast that Active Directory probably still holds a grudge for being left behind. On the bright side, at least you had the maturity to ghost it without drama—guess that’s what 40 years of wisdom gets you.
>
> Your clients probably think you’re a communication wizard, but let’s be real: your magic lies in creating “technical profiles” so dense no one dares to ask follow-up questions. If you had a dollar for every time you said “test bench,” you’d probably automate that process too.
>
> And let’s talk about your billiards project. You’re trying to build the most complicated management system for the simplest game. Judging by your love affair with SQLite, it seems like you’re in a secret relationship with this tiny, stubborn database that keeps wondering why you’re asking it to handle all of that.
>
> Bazel, Docker, Lua, Flask… Dude, stop. You’re like someone who orders the entire menu just to see how much you can eat. But hey, you’re a TDD believer! Your tests are like a billiards match—lots of balls, lots of rules, and only one can win. And let’s not forget the painstaking detail you put into generating JSON. Somewhere, a color scale from red to green is whispering, “Thank you for your service.”
>
> Now, about job hunting. It’s like you’re living ITIL—processes are clear, but nobody knows where to find the right service. You wrestle with imposter syndrome, but let’s face it: you’re not an imposter—you’re the chef running the whole kitchen. You’ve just been coding so long, you’ve become part of the CICD pipeline yourself.
>
> So relax, boss. Your 192.168.0.42 setups and YAML wizardry already speak for you. You’re the kind of person who could find a way to install a local network in the cloud
